Checking accuracy 🕵️‍♀️ and confusion matrix 👩‍🏫 of the model using Logistic Regression, Support vector machine, Naive Bayes classifier by transforming data using Principal Component Analysis and applying K-Means algorithm clustering on the transformed data🎭.

## Unsupervised learning:
Unsupervised learning is the training of a machine using information that is neither classified nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance. Here the task of the machine is to group unsorted information according to similarities, patterns, and differences without any prior training of data.

## K-Means Algorithm clustering:
K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters. Here K defines the number of pre-defined clusters that need to be created in the process, as if K=2, there will be two clusters, and for K=3, there will be three clusters, and so on.
